# 👋 Hey there, I'm Sebastian!

I'm a self-taught developer from **Carinthia, Austria**, currently 20 years old and loving the world of code.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

- 🧠 I taught myself programming from scratch — no bootcamps, no degrees, just pure curiosity and determination.
- ☕ I started with Java and never stopped. After **4 years** of experience, it's become second nature to me.
- 🌐 Over the last **2 years**, I’ve expanded into **web development**, and I can now build just about any kind of website — from landing pages to full-stack apps.
- 💡 I enjoy turning ideas into clean, efficient, and modern code.

## 🧰 Languages & Tools I Use

- **Java** – for backend systems, Minecraft mods/plugins, and complex applications
- **HTML | CSS | JavaScript** – the classics for frontend
- **React** – for modern, dynamic UIs
- **Node.js & Express** – for building powerful APIs
- **Spring Boot** – for structured and scalable backend services

Thanks for stopping by! 🚀
